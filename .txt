# Valentine’s Puzzle

An interactive sliding puzzle website designed to ask someone to be your Valentine.

# Features

Animated envelope that opens on click

3×3 sliding puzzle using your custom image

Smooth animations and visual effects

Confetti celebration when she clicks “Yes”

Fully mobile responsive

# Setup

1. Prepare Your Image Tiles

Cut your image into 3×3 squares (I used Figma, but you can also generate them programmatically).

Place all 9 PNG tiles inside the images/ folder.

Replace the full image at:

images/full-image.png

Name your tiles:

tile-1.png through tile-9.png

Tiles should be ordered left-to-right, top-to-bottom:

tile-1.png   tile-2.png   tile-3.png  
tile-4.png   tile-5.png   tile-6.png  
tile-7.png   tile-8.png   tile-9.png  

Note: tile-3.png acts as the empty space (top-right corner) during gameplay and appears once the puzzle is completed.

2. Update the Text

Make sure to edit the relevant strings in index.html (names, messages, etc.).

Unless your Valentine is also named “Tasia,” this step is important.

# How It Works

Stage 0: A letter appears on screen — click to open.

Stage 1: She solves the 3×3 sliding puzzle to reveal your photo.

Stage 2: The full image appears with:

“…you complete me.”
“Will you be my Valentine?”
Along with a Yes button.

Stage 3: She clicks “Yes” — celebration time.

# Customization

All messages (greeting, puzzle completion text, final screen) can be customized in index.html.

Made for Valentine’s Day.
